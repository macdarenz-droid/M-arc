## Owner answers
D1: done (R0.0, key 05:66:9A…F1:F5) · D2–D15: default

## Owner actions (collected; STOP once at the end)
- [ ] R0: dispatch "Deploy Escobar Worker", confirm /health quotas:true
- [ ] R0: if the deploy fails because Durable Objects are unavailable, run `npx wrangler kv namespace create QUOTA` and bind `QUOTA` in wrangler.toml
- [ ] R0.0: keep the encrypted key backup → add the new fingerprint in AppGallery Connect → backup, uninstall, reinstall, restore → delete SECRETS_WRITE_TOKEN and the `marc-debug-signing-v1` caches

## Phase R0 — in progress
